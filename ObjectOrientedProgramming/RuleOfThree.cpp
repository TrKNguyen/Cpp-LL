/*
    The famous rule of three

It is a very well-known C++ principle say that if a class requires 
a user-defined copy constructor, copy assignment and destructor, then
it probably requires all three. In C++11, this was expanded to the rule 
of fiveeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

When we have move constructor and move assignment alsooo.
